A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by
different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments
for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python
developers use.

## commands:

# install:
pip install virtualenv

# create:
# here myvirtualenv is the name of virtual environment
python -m venv myvirtualenv

# we must activate the virtual environment before using
cd myvirtualenv
cd Scripts
# for activate
activate

# for deactivate
deactivate

# if we check the installed list when virtual environment is activated, it just
shows the default installations
pip list

# so we can install any perticular tools for the particular project in this
virtual environment, which does not effect or effected by the real environment
of the pc
pip install django==2.2.4

# we can add different tools together  by using requirement.txt file into the
environment & we have to install this as requirement into the environment
cd ..
pip install -r requirement.txt
